{% comment %} 
  A fullscreen overlay of zoomable product images. This snippet is used to display a fullscreen gallery of product images, 
  where each image can be zoomed in and out by clicking on it. The gallery also supports navigation through arrows.

  Accepts:
  - is_featured: {boolean} Assigns product object from section settings. Set this to true if block is used within a section rather than product template.

  Usage:
    {% render 'product__gallery-fullscreen', 
      is_featured: true 
    %}

  Recommendations:
  - Use this snippet to display a fullscreen gallery of product images in a product detail page.
  - Ensure that the product images are high resolution as they can be zoomed in.
